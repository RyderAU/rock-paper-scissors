# rock-paper-scissors
## Description
Game of rock, paper, scissors played in the console. Currently has basic functionality and output displayed in the browser console. Project will be revisited to add a graphical user interface and possibly expand on functionality.
## Problem Solving
### Understand the Problem
The program will play 5 rounds of the game rock, paper, scissors in the browser console. At the start of each round, both the player and the computer will make a selection and the winner will be determined. At the end of the 5 rounds, whoever has the most round wins, wins the game.
### Plan
#### Pseudocode
Take the user's selection and set the computer's selection

Compare the selections

Increment the winner's score by one

Loop 5 times

At the end of the 5 loops, declare the winner
### Divide and Conquer
Create functionality to take a user's input and check it with console.log(). Then implement a way to set a random selection for the computer. Do this for one round and then loop it 5 times.
