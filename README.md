# rock-paper-scissors
## Description
Game of rock, paper, scissors played in the console. Currently has basic functionality and output displayed in the browser console. Project will be revisited to add a graphical user interface and possibly expand on functionality.
## Problem Solving
### Understand the Problem
The program will play rounds of the game rock, paper, scissors in the browser console. At the start of each round, both the player and the computer will make a selection and the winner will be determined. Whoever reaches 5 rounds won first, wins the game.
### Plan
#### Pseudocode
Take the user's selection and set the computer's selection

Compare the selections

Increment the winner's score by one

Continue until someone reaches 5 wins 
### Divide and Conquer
Create functionality to take a user's input and check it with console.log(). Then implement a way to set a random selection for the computer. Do this for one round and then repeat multiple times.
